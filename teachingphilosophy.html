        <p>As an educator for over a decade and a licensed teacher in the state of Illinois, I have worked in the Harlem School District as a high school physics and earth and space science teacher, where I taught AP Physics, Honors Physics, Meteorology and Climatology, Astronomy, Oceanography, and STEAM Physics. I have also been a graduate teaching assistant and instructor at Northern Illinois University in the department of Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment, teaching Physical Geography lab, Planetary and Space Science, Synoptic Meteorology lab, and Weather Dynamics. In these positions, I have designed and implemented high school, undergraduate, and graduate level curricula that engaged students in scientific inquiry, focusing on real-world problems and applications of earth science and physics concepts.
        </p>
        <p>My approach to teaching is rooted in student-centered, culturally responsive education, where I leverage the backgrounds and cultural frames of reference of students. My goal is to make course content and skills relevant to each student, connecting these to their daily lives and experiences. In addition to this approach, I incorporate inquiry-based learning into my courses, where I structure lessons based on an overarching problem or question that is current and relevant to students. I aim to foster a learning environment where students feel seen and empowered to succeed, regardless of and in celebration of their unique backgrounds. My classes balance lecture, small group discussion activities, and hands-on learning activities, where I relinquish my role as “sage on the stage” in order to guide students through critical thinking activities. I use a variety of assessment methods, including traditional exams and check in quizzes as well as projects and presentations that allow students to demonstrate what they have learned in the context of a problem that is important to them. This allows me to address different learning styles and interests while maintaining course standards and rigor.
