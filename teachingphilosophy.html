            <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
            <p><i>My teaching philosophy reflects over a decade of experience as both a licensed high school teacher and a university instructor, grounded in student-centered and inquiry-based learning.</i></p>

            <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
            <p>
                In the Harlem School District, I taught AP Physics, Honors Physics, Meteorology and Climatology, Astronomy, Oceanography, and STEAM Physics. 
                At Northern Illinois University, I have served as a graduate teaching assistant and instructor for courses including Weather Dynamics Lecutre and Lab, 
                Physical Geography Lab, Planetary and Space Science Lecutre, and Synoptic Meteorology Lab. 
                Across these roles, I designed and implemented curricula at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, 
                engaging students in scientific inquiry and real-world applications of Earth science and physics concepts.

            <h2>Student-Centered and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</h2>
            <p>
                My approach is rooted in student-centered, culturally responsive education, where I leverage the backgrounds and cultural frames of reference 
                of students. My goal is to make course content relevant to each student, connecting lessons to their lived experiences. I aim to foster a 
                learning environment where students feel seen and empowered to succeed, 
                regardless of and in celebration of their unique backgrounds.”</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Inquiry-Based Learning</h2>
            <p>
                I design lessons around current and relevant problems or questions. My classes balance lecture, small-group activities, and hands-on learning. 
                Rather than being a “sage on the stage,” I act as a guide, helping students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
            </p>

            <h2>Assessment and Student Success</h2>
            <p>
                I use diverse assessments, including traditional exams and quizzes alongside projects and presentations, that allow students to demonstrate 
                learning in the context of problems that are important to them. This approach supports multiple learning styles and interests while maintaining 
                rigor and course standards. My ultimate goal is to prepare students not only to master course content, but also to transfer their learning 
                to real-world challenges and opportunities.
