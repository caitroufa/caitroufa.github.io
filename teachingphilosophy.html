            <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
            <p>
                In the Harlem School District, I taught AP Physics, Honors Physics, Meteorology and Climatology, Astronomy, Oceanography, and STEAM Physics. 
                At Northern Illinois University, I served as a graduate teaching assistant and instructor for courses including Physical Geography Lab, 
                Planetary and Space Science, Synoptic Meteorology Lab, and Weather Dynamics. 
                Across these roles, I designed and implemented curricula at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, 
                engaging students in scientific inquiry and real-world applications of Earth science and physics concepts.

            <h2>Student-Centered and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</h2>
            <p>
                My approach is rooted in student-centered, culturally responsive education, where I draw on the backgrounds and cultural frames of reference 
                of students. My goal is to make course content relevant to each student, connecting lessons to their lived experiences while 
                celebrating their unique identities.

                <p>“I aim to foster a learning environment where students feel seen and empowered to succeed, regardless of and in celebration of their unique backgrounds.”</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Inquiry-Based Learning</h2>
            <p>
                I design lessons around current and relevant problems or questions. My classes balance lecture, small-group activities, and hands-on learning. 
                Rather than being a “sage on the stage,” I act as a guide, helping students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

        <section>
            <h2>Assessment and Student Success</h2>
            <p>
                I use diverse assessments—including traditional exams and quizzes alongside projects and presentations—that allow students to demonstrate 
                learning in contexts that matter to them. This approach supports multiple learning styles and interests while maintaining rigor 
                and course standards. My ultimate goal is to prepare students not only to master course content, but also to transfer their learning 
                to real-world challenges and opportunities.

<!--     <section>
        <p>As an educator for over a decade and a licensed teacher in the state of Illinois, I have worked in the Harlem School District as a high school physics and earth and space science teacher, where I taught AP Physics, Honors Physics, Meteorology and Climatology, Astronomy, Oceanography, and STEAM Physics. I have also been a graduate teaching assistant and instructor at Northern Illinois University in the department of Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment, teaching Physical Geography lab, Planetary and Space Science, Synoptic Meteorology lab, and Weather Dynamics. In these positions, I have designed and implemented high school, undergraduate, and graduate level curricula that engaged students in scientific inquiry, focusing on real-world problems and applications of earth science and physics concepts.
        </p>
        <p>My approach to teaching is rooted in student-centered, culturally responsive education, where I leverage the backgrounds and cultural frames of reference of students. My goal is to make course content and skills relevant to each student, connecting these to their daily lives and experiences. In addition to this approach, I incorporate inquiry-based learning into my courses, where I structure lessons based on an overarching problem or question that is current and relevant to students. I aim to foster a learning environment where students feel seen and empowered to succeed, regardless of and in celebration of their unique backgrounds. My classes balance lecture, small group discussion activities, and hands-on learning activities, where I relinquish my role as “sage on the stage” in order to guide students through critical thinking activities. I use a variety of assessment methods, including traditional exams and check in quizzes as well as projects and presentations that allow students to demonstrate what they have learned in the context of a problem that is important to them. This allows me to address different learning styles and interests while maintaining course standards and rigor.
