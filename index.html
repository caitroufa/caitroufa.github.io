                <p>Hi! I'm Cait.</p>
                <p>I'm a weather and physics nerd on the path to completing a PhD. My journey has been a study in resiliance, coming from a low-income, single-parent home, a first generation college student, working as a custodian, an office assistant, file clerk, retail associate, dance teacher, and conservation worker during college, and later going back to school as a non-traditional student and mom. I understand the value of persistence.</p>
                <p>I believe that hard work, tenacity, a collaborative attitude, and kindness have brought me to where I am today. I've experienced weightlessness, starting a microgravity research program in partnership with NASA that is ongoing nearly twenty years later. As an educator, I've created and implemented research-based curriculum for middle school, high school, and college level physics, astronomy, and meteorology courses, connecting with and mentoring hundreds of students in the process. And more recently, I have led a team studying the long-term severe weather perils landscape in the US.</p>
                <p>My research interests include <b>large scale climate dynamics, teleconnections, and severe weather climatology</b>. After earning my degree in 2026, my goal is to pursue a research or academic career in atmospheric science or a climate data science position in industry.</p>
                <p>I have a BA in Physics, an Illinois Professional Educator's License with endorsements in physics, earth and space sci, and chemistry, and a MA in Physics Education. I have a decade of experience as a science educator, curriculum developer, and content leader/expert, with a background in physics research and engineering (nuclear/chemical, astrophysics, mechanical). In addition to working on my PhD, I am currently completing a graduate certificate in GIS Analysis.</p>
                <p>When I'm not engaged in research, you will find me with my family exploring the US in a 1981 VW Westfalia Vanagon, taking photos of the night sky, and listening to live music.</p>
