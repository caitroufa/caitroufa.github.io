        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am pursuing a PhD at NIU in the Department of Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment and am part of the Weather, Climate, and Society Research Group where I lead a team studying the long-term severe weather perils landscape in the US. My research interests include large scale climate dynamics, teleconnections, and severe weather climatology. After earning my degree in 2026, my goal is to pursue a research or academic career in atmospheric science or a climate data science position in industry.
.</p>
        <p>I have a BA in Physics, an Illinois Professional Educator's License with endorsements in physics, earth and space sci, and chemistry, and a MA in Physics Education. I have a decade of experience as a science educator, curriculum developer, and content leader/expert, with a background in physics research and engineering (nuclear/chemical, astrophysics, mechanical). I am currently completing a graduate certificate in GIS Analysis.</p>
