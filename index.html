                <p>Hi! I'm Cait.</p>
                <p>I'm a weather and physics nerd on the path to completing a PhD in Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment. My journey has been a study in resiliance, coming from a low-income single-parent home, becoming a first generation college student, working as a custodian, an office assistant, file clerk, retail associate, dance teacher, and conservation worker to get through college, and later going back to school as a non-traditional student and mom. I believe that hard work, tenacity, a collaborative attitude, and kindness have brought me to where I am today.</p>
                <p>I am pursuing a PhD at NIU in the Department of Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment and am part of the Weather, Climate, and Society Research Group where I lead a team studying the long-term severe weather perils landscape in the US. My research interests include <b>large scale climate dynamics, teleconnections, and severe weather climatology</b>. After earning my degree in 2026, my goal is to pursue a research or academic career in atmospheric science or a climate data science position in industry.</p>
                <p>I have a BA in Physics, an Illinois Professional Educator's License with endorsements in physics, earth and space sci, and chemistry, and a MA in Physics Education. I have a decade of experience as a science educator, curriculum developer, and content leader/expert, with a background in physics research and engineering (nuclear/chemical, astrophysics, mechanical). I am currently completing a graduate certificate in GIS Analysis.</p>
