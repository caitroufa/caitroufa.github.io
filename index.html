                <p>Hi! I'm Cait.</p>
                <p>I'm a weather and physics nerd on the path to completing a PhD. My research interests include <b>large scale climate dynamics, teleconnections, and severe weather climatology</b>. I am particularly passionate about mentoring and educating others and in community and climate justice issues. I value hard work, tenacity, kindness, and collaboration and enjoy exploring complex problems. When I am not engaged in research, you will find me exploring the US in a 1981 VW Westfalia Vanagon with my family, taking photos of the sky, hiking or running with my dog, and listening to live music.</b>

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a PhD Student and GTA at Northern Illinois University, where I study atmospheric science and GIS and plan and teach Weather Dynamics 1 and 2. My current research projects within the Weather, Climate, and Society Research Group focus on large scale climate dynamics, and the future severe weather perils landscape in the US.</p>
        <p>My journey has been a study in resilience, coming from a low-income, single-parent home, a first generation college student, working multiple jobs as a custodian, retail, office, conservation, and more during college, and later going back to school as a non-traditional student and mom. I understand the value of persistence and ambition, which have led me to many opportunities in science and education. I've experienced weightlessness, starting a microgravity research program in partnership with NASA that is ongoing nearly twenty years later. As an educator for over a decade, I've created and implemented research-based curriculum for middle school, high school, and college level physics, astronomy, and meteorology courses, connecting with and mentoring hundreds of students in the process. And more recently, I have led a team studying the long-term severe weather perils landscape in the US.</p>
