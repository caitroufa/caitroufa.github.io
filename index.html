          <h2>Hi! I'm Cait.</h2>
          <p>I'm a weather and physics nerd on the path to completing a PhD in Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment. My research explores 
          <b>large-scale climate dynamics, S2S forecasting, and severe weather climatology</b>. I'm particularly passionate about mentoring, teaching, and in community impact. When I'm not at work, you will find me traveling in an '81 VW Westfalia Vanagon with my family, photographing the world around me, hiking with my dog, reading, and enjoying live music.</p>

        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>Currently, I am a PhD Candidate and GTA at Northern Illinois University, where I study atmospheric science and GIS and teach <b>Weather Dynamics I & II</b>. 
            Within the <b>Weather, Climate, and Society Research Group</b>, I lead a project on the future severe convective weather perils landscape in the US.</p>
    
        <p>Growing up in the rural Midwest fostered my love for open skies, astronomy, and weather. Not knowing about opportunities in atmospheric science, 
            nor wanting to be a broadcast meteorologist, I first pursued a <b>BA in Physics</b>. My interest in both the skies and education deepened while living in 
            Idaho’s mountains, where I worked as a substitute teacher. That experience led me back to school for an <b>Illinois Professional Educator's License</b> and 
            an <b>MA in Physics Education</b>.</p>    

        <p>While teaching high school physics and earth and space science classes, I developed curriculum that highlighted role models and careers in STEM. 
            During one lesson featuring a meteorologist, I found myself thinking, “<i>I've always wanted to do something like that—why am I not doing that?!</i>” 
            When Covid opened opportunities for online learning, I took a course at NIU, where I connected with my mentor, Dr. Victor Gensini, who encouraged me 
            when I wanted to apply for a PhD. So here I am, working toward the goal of becoming “Dr. Roufa” and enjoying my time exploring the field.</p>

        <p>My journey has also been one of resilience. As a first-generation college student from a low-income, single-parent home, I worked multiple jobs—including custodian, retail, and conservation roles—before returning to graduate school as a non-traditional student and mom. Along the way, I’ve built programs that have created lasting impact: from starting a NASA microgravity research partnership nearly twenty years ago that is still ongoing, to mentoring hundreds of students through high school and university teaching.</p>
        
        <p>Today, my work bridges atmospheric research, education, and community engagement. I value persistence, kindness, and collaboration, and I look forward to continuing my path as a scientist and educator.</p>
