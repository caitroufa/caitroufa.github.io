                <p>I'm a weather and physics nerd on the path to completing a PhD. My research interests include <b>large scale climate dynamics, teleconnections, and severe weather climatology</b>. I am particularly passionate about mentoring and educating others and in community and climate justice issues. I value hard work, tenacity, kindness, and collaboration and enjoy exploring complex problems. When I am not engaged in research, you will find me traveling the US in a 1981 VW Westfalia Vanagon with my family, taking photos of the sky, hiking or running with my dog, reading fantasy and scifi, and listening to live music.</b>

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a PhD Student and GTA at Northern Illinois University, where I study atmospheric science and GIS and plan and teach Weather Dynamics 1 and 2. My current research projects within the Weather, Climate, and Society Research Group focus on large scale climate dynamics, and the future severe convective weather perils landscape in the US.</p>
        <p>Growing up in the rural Midwest, I developed a love for open skies, astronomy, and weather. Not knowing about opportunities in atmospheric science nor wanting to be a broadcast meteorologist, I pursued a BA in Physics. My interest in the skies and in education were solidified while living in the harsh and beautiful mountains of Idaho, where I worked as a substitute teacher. Returning to school, I obtained an Illinois Professional Educator's License and an MA in Physics Education. While teaching high school physics and earth and space science classes, I developed and implemented curriculum exposing students to role models and careers in STEM. During one of these lessons that featured a meteorologist, I found myself asking, “I've always wanted to do something like that. Why am I not doing that?” Covid gave me the opportunity to take an online course at NIU, where I connected with my mentor, Dr. Victor Gensini, who encouraged me when I wanted to apply for a PhD. So here I am, working toward the goal of becoming “Dr. Roufa” and enjoying my time exploring the field.</p>
        <p>My journey has been a study in resilience, coming from a low-income, single-parent home, a first generation college student, working multiple jobs as a custodian, retail, office, conservation, and more during college, and later going back to school as a non-traditional student and mom. I understand the value of persistence and ambition, which have led me to many opportunities in science and education. I've experienced weightlessness, starting a microgravity research program in partnership with NASA that is ongoing nearly twenty years later. As an educator for over a decade, I've created and implemented research-based curriculum for middle school, high school, and college level physics, astronomy, and meteorology courses, connecting with and mentoring hundreds of students in the process. And more recently, I have led a team studying the long-term severe convective weather perils landscape in the US. I am looking forward to what lies ahead as I continue on this path.</p>
